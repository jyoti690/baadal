Install refering to the official openstack installation guide for ubuntu 14.04 Kilo (located at http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/index.html)

For networing, use neutron networking (not nova-networking)

Follow the guide for rest of the process, till network creation.

edit /etc/neutron/dhcp_agent.ini file in the controller node to contain the following value
dhcp_domain = iitd.ac.in

Create a router by following the guide. (Do not change the name of the external network, keep it 'ext-net')

Create internal network using the below command
$ neutron net-create --tenant-id $tenant NETWORK_NAME --provider:network_type gre --provider:segmentation_id SEGMENTATION_ID

create subnet in each network using the below command
$ neutron subnet-create --tenant-id $tenant --name SUBNET_NAME NETWORK_NAME CIDR

set gateways for each subnet by issuing the below command
neutron subnet-update SUBNET_ID --dns-nameservers list=true 10.208.20.2 10.208.20.19 10.10.1.2

Attach the created subnet to the previuosly created router
$ neutron router-interface-add ROUTER_NAME SUBNET_NAME

Create one security group each for all internal networks with the same name as of the networks.
Create rules to allow all traffic between VMs for each security group.
$ neutron security-group-rule-create --direction egress --ethertype IPv4 --remote-group-id vlan2 vlan2

Create other security groups and respective rules as required.
For example, to open web access from VMs, create group golbal_http, write appropriate rules and
    add this security group to all machines from which you want to enable web access.

#Attach instances in each internal network to their respective security groups.

Following configuration of VM has been used for setting up openstack on VM (using VirtualBox):
Network Node
    1 GB RAM, 8GB HDD, 1VCPU
    4 NICs
    first interface connected to NAT for Internet Access during installation (may be removed after installation)
    second interface connected to host-only-network-1 (management network) with static IP address
    third interface connected to host-only-network-2 (instance tunnel network) with static IP address (allow promiscous mode)
    fourth interface bridged to physical NIC of the host (which is connected to external network),
        with no IP address, (follow the installation guide to configure this), to provide access to external network for
        instances (Internet, IITD LAN), allow promiscous mode

Controller Node
    2GB RAM, 8GB HDD, 2VPUs
    2 NICs
    first interface connected to NAT for Internet Access during installation (may be removed after installation)
    second interface connected to host-only-network-1 (management network) with static IP address

Compute Nodes
    3GB RAM, 8GBHDD, 3VCPUs
    3 NICs
    first interface connected to NAT for Internet Access during installation (may be removed after installation)
    second interface connected to host-only-network-1 (management network) with static IP address
    third interface connected to host-only-network-2 (instance tunnel network) with static IP address (allow promiscous mode)
